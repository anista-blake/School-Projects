          <p> Recently, I've been really inspired to start writing my own story and turning it into a video game. However, I currently have no drawing or game creation skills, and I haven't written anything creatively in years, so this project will take a little bit to kickstart. Maybe for now, I'll continue trying to conceptialize the main characters and the overall plot before I attempt to start writing. I also want to practice drawing and thinking about what type of gameplay would suit the story. </p>
          <p> The websites in the nav bar are just a couple that I have saved that would aid me in either storytelling, character creation, or art and game making tutorials. I may not need to use all of them, but I feel like for now, they are a good start to this personal project I want to develop. This is not an exhaustive list, and I plan to look for more references when I get deeper into this project. </p>
          <p> Since I'm allowed to make this page about whatever I want, I figured that I might as well create something that'll help me conceptualize a project I want to work on at the same time. If I'm able to at least start making some bit of progress on this game, it could not only prove that I'm capable of creating something good and fun, but it might also improve my chances of being hired when I eventually develop a portfolio. Maybe this will help me discover my purpose, because as of right now, I'm not 100% confident in my creative and technical abilities. </p>

          <section> I've taken a lot of inspiration from role playing games and platformers, with the main one right now being Honkai: Star Rail. I love how unique and diverse each character's appearance and personalities are and I like the way they each have different ways of fighting. The setting allows for there to be characters who are not basic humans, and the player can go to different planets to experience different cultures and environments. </section>
